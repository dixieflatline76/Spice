Spice is a minimalist wallpaper manager that brings a continuous stream of delight to your screen while not getting in your way. It automatically downloads high-quality wallpapers from your favorite image services like Wallhaven and Unsplash, keeping your desktop fresh and fun.

**Note:** Spice runs quietly in your **Windows system tray** or **macOS menu bar**, doing its magic in the background while giving you full control when you need it.
