# Spice - A Windows Desktop Background Manager

Spice is a work-in-progress desktop background manager for Windows, inspired by Variety. Built entirely in Go and using Fyne for its minimalist UI (system tray icon and menu), Spice aims to provide a seamless and customizable wallpaper experience.

## Current Features

* **Wallhaven.cc support:**  Fetch wallpapers from Wallhaven, with support for API keys.
* **Multiple image queries:** Define multiple queries to diversify your wallpaper collection (e.g., one for landscapes, another for abstract art).
* **System tray controls:** Easily navigate through your wallpaper cache with next, previous, and random image options.
* **Daily image cache refresh:** Keep your wallpapers fresh with automatic cache updates every midnight.
* **On-demand image download:**  Spice downloads the next batch of images only when needed, optimizing performance.

## Future Plans

Spice is under active development! Here's what's on the roadmap:

* **Expanded wallpaper sources:** Support for more wallpaper services beyond Wallhaven.
* **User interface improvements:**  A dedicated UI for easier configuration, eliminating the need to manually edit config.json.
* **Windows Service support:** Improved background service integration.

## Current Status

Spice is currently in its early stages and primarily tested on Windows 11.
